    "# 01. Neural Network Regression with TensorFlow (INTERACTIVE VERSION)\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many definitions for a [regression problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_analysis) but in our case, we're going to simplify it to be: predicting a number.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, you might want to:\n",
    "- Predict the selling price of houses given information about them (such as number of rooms, size, number of bathrooms).\n",
    "- Predict the coordinates of a bounding box of an item in an image.\n",
    "- Predict the cost of medical insurance for an individual given their demographics (age, sex, gender, race).\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we're going to set the foundations for how you can take a sample of inputs (this is your data), build a neural network to discover patterns in those inputs and then make a prediction (in the form of a number) based on those inputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What we're going to cover\n",
    "\n",
    "Specifically, we're going to go through doing the following with TensorFlow:\n",
    "- Architecture of a regression model\n",
    "- Input shapes and output shapes\n",
    "  - `X`: features/data (inputs)\n",
    "  - `y`: labels (outputs)\n",
    "- Creating custom data to view and fit\n",
    "- Steps in modelling\n",
    "  - Creating a model\n",
    "  - Compiling a model\n",
    "    - Defining a loss function\n",
    "    - Setting up an optimizer\n",
    "    - Creating evaluation metrics\n",
    "  - Fitting a model (getting it to find patterns in our data)\n",
    "- Evaluating a model\n",
    "  - Visualizng the model (\"visualize, visualize, visualize\")\n",
    "  - Looking at training curves\n",
    "  - Compare predictions to ground truth (using our evaluation metrics)\n",
    "- Saving a model (so we can use it later)\n",
    "- Loading a model\n",
    "\n",
    "Don't worry if none of these make sense now, we're going to go through each.\n",
    "\n",
    "## How you can use this notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "Run each line of code, and do the interactive quizzes which will be marked with this ❓ emoji."

    "> **Note:** If you're using [TensorFlow 2.7.0](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/releases/tag/v2.7.0)+, the `fit()` function no longer upscales input data to go from `(batch_size, )` to `(batch_size, 1)`. To fix this, you'll need to expand the dimension of input data using `tf.expand_dims(input_data, axis=-1)`.\n",

    "\n",
    "A common practice when working with neural networks is to make sure all of the data you pass to them is in the range 0 to 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "This practice is called **normalization** (scaling all values from their original range to, e.g. between 0 and 100,000 to be between 0 and 1).\n",
    "\n",
    "There is another process call **standardization** which converts all of your data to unit variance and 0 mean.\n",
    "\n",
    "These two practices are often part of a preprocessing pipeline (a series of functions to prepare your data for use with neural networks).\n",
    "\n",
    "Knowing this, some of the major steps you'll take to preprocess your data for a neural network include:\n",
    "* Turning all of your data to numbers (a neural network can't handle strings).\n",
    "* Making sure your data is in the right shape (verifying input and output shapes).\n",
    "* [**Feature scaling**](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/preprocessing.html#preprocessing-scaler):\n",
    "    * Normalizing data (making sure all values are between 0 and 1). This is done by subtracting the minimum value then dividing by the maximum value minus the minmum. This is also referred to as min-max scaling.\n",
    "    * Standardization (making sure all values have a mean of 0 and a variance of 1). This is done by substracting the mean value from the target feature and then dividing it by the standard deviation.\n",
    "    * Which one should you use?\n",
    "      * **With neural networks you'll tend to favour normalization** as they tend to prefer values between 0 and 1 (you'll see this espcially with image processing), however, you'll often find a neural network can perform pretty well with minimal feature scaling.\n",
